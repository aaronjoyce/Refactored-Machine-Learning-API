# Manifesto:
#	Mission 1:
# 	To build extensive, distributed, and concurrent-operating machine-learning tools
#	for the purpose of analysing large quantities of human genome data, 
#	to enable the identification of correlations between genomic components
#	and pathogens (things that causes disease). 
#	Mission 2:
# 	Using identified correlations, re-engineer genetic components to either 
# 	prevent the development of diseases; i.e., eliminate known pathogens, 
#	or to halt an existing disease-progression process. 

# 	Tasks (time-frame: 1-2 weeks)
#		- To build some "simple" machine-learning models, test their performance 
#		  on human genome data with known disease correlations, and iterate from there. 
#			-> Identify candidate models;
#			-> Build candidate models;
#			-> Due to the size of genome data, identify and develop suitable
#			   feature-selection models;
#			-> Test models;
#			-> Evaluate progress;
#			-> Using promising candidate models, begin the distribution process. 
#			Note: While building algorithms, give generalisation some attention, as
#			as well as load-distribution framework interfaces.
